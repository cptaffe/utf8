# utf8
utf-8 library for parsing runes.

utf8 aims to be a simple, compliant, idiomatic implementation of a utf-8 parser in C. It includes `utf8_encode` and `utf8_decode` for rune encoding from codepoint value (U+xxxxxx) and rune decoding to codepoint. utf8 also provides a utf8_parser for moving through strings of utf8 text rune-by-rune, utility functions for strings, etc.
